            <h1>Activities And Company's details</h1>
            <p>
              The company has been set up as a Limited Liability Company (Sole
              Proprietorship) and it was officially launched 20 years ago, as a
              family business. The main activity of the company is distribution
              of quality wines produced in Macedonia (in particular the Kumanovo
              region) to wholesalers and retailers (restaurants, supermarkets,
              wine stores). The company has extensive experience in wine
              distribution on the domestic market, as well as on the regional
              market (Serbia and Croatia). In 2018 company the company was
              rebranded (KOVIN export-import DOOEL) A new business concept and
              strategy was developed and adopted including sales and promotional
              strategy. The changes were initiated and implemented by the new
              owner and manager (family business successor), Mrs Marija
              Stojanovska.

                  “My goal is to ensure continuation of the family business by
                  implementing new business concepts and strategies that will
                  enable building of profitable, sustainable and socially
                  responsible company which will be recognized on the domestic
                  as well as the European market. Since I was a kid, I have been
                  involved in the business activities of the company from
                  different aspects, which gave me the opportunity to develop
                  the necessary skills for wine sales and promotion. Currently,
                  I am enrolled in a university, in a course for economics,
                  finances and accounting. My ambition is to build a career
                  through self-employment and entrepreneurial initiatives and as
                  a business woman to help other women who seek employment or
                  want to start their own business. I strongly believe in the
                  concept of lifelong learning and I will strive to create
                  employment opportunities and offer trainings for personal
                  development for the company’s employees and women with less
                  opportunities and single mothers from the North-eastern region
                  of the country. The social aspect is very important part of
                  the company’s vision and hopefully it will become more and
                  more visible as the company develops. The field of
                  distribution management is a large and exciting field with
                  great career opportunities, salaries and earnings.
                  Distribution managers or employess, generally work standard
                  hours from Monday to Friday in office, which is very
                  convenient for women that would like to balance family and
                  career”
